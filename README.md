 <h1>0x16. C - Simple Shell</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>

The Simple Shell assignment serves as a pivotal milestone within the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, providing students with an introduction to the complexities of shell functionality and system programming. Students are tasked with creating a rudimentary Unix-like shell that emulates the fundamental characteristics of a command-line interface as part of this endeavor.

<h1>Project Objectives:</h1>

1) The understanding of process management is emphasized in this undertaking through the utilization of the fork() and exec() system calls to initiate and execute processes.

2) Acquiring Proficiency in Input/Output Operations: Learners acquire practical knowledge and skills in managing user input, deciphering commands, and engaging with the underlying operating system.

3) The successful completion of the project necessitates the creation of fundamental shell capabilities, including but not limited to command history, environment variable administration, and file manipulation.

4) Debugging and Error Handling: Students acquire the ability to recognize and gracefully manage errors, thereby guaranteeing the resilience of their shell implementation.


<h1>Key Features of the Simple Shell:</h1>

1) Command Interpretation: The shell is responsible for deciphering and carrying out user-entered commands by parsing them into comprehensible parameters.

2) Integrated Commands: The shell ought to incorporate a collection of integrated commands, including echo, env, and cd, which furnish fundamental shell functionalities.

3) File Management: The shell ought to incorporate functionalities that enable users to perform various operations on files, such as creating, viewing, writing, and deleting.

4) The shell is responsible for the management of environment variables, enabling users to both set and retrieve values from the environment.

5) Error Handling: In order to prevent program failures and ensure appropriate error messages are displayed, the shell should handle errors in a graceful manner.
